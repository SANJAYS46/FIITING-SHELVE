# FIITING-SHELVE
FITTING SHELVE PROBLEM USING GREEDY


In greedy algorithm, we either try to minimise, or maximise certain quantity at each and every stage. Here, we will be trying to minimze the empty space on the wall at every stage ,and store it in a counter variable which will be used to keep track of the minimum empty space along with counter variables for correspnding number of shelves of length m and n used. And, we will then iterate according to the greedy algorithm steps mentioned below to achieve the desired solution.
the shelves aare fitted into the wall such a way that the remaining space on the wall should be minimum and the given constraints are the shelve with the larger size costs less hence we are concentrating more on the shelve with larger size
